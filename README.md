<h1>My Portfolio</h1>

### This project is designed to reflect my growth, education and experience to become a full stack developer in the future.

#### Website construction consists of five categories⚙️:

1. Início (Home)
2. Sobre (About)
3. Educação (Education)
4. Habilidades (Skills)
5. Portfólio (Portfolio)

#### More details about each page:

  * <h3>Início (Home)</h3>
  The Home page consists of a brief presentation about who I am and what I want to become. It includes a navbar to access the other pages, my name, a description, resume, contact form, links to my GitHub, LinkedIn and Whatsapp.

  * <h3>Sobre (About)</h3> 
  On the About page, there is a small presentation about me just to instigate the user to click on "read more" (which will direct them to the about page) and understand more about my journey as a Dev.

  * <h3>Educação (Education)</h3>
  We arrived at the Education tab, and in it we have some of the main courses that I have already taken or that I am still taking. In them I briefly describe what I have learned so far.

  * <h3>Habilidades (Skills)</h3>
  On the Skills page, I show in percentage chart format my current coding skills.

  * <h3>Portfólio (Portfolio)</h3>
  On the Portfolio page, I present projects that I carry out, whether they are back or front end. Currently there is only one project which is the portfolio itself, but over time I will add more projects.
